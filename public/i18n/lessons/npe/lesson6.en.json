  "intro": "In this lesson, you'll learn how to combine speed control and drag effects to create realistic particle physics. You'll use ParticleLerpBlock to create speed transitions (fast to slow), and combine it with drag calculations to simulate air resistance. By combining both effects, you create particles that start fast, slow down over time, and experience drag - creating more natural, physics-based movement.",

  "codeTitle": "Code Explanation",
  "codeCopy": "This lesson demonstrates combining speed control and drag effects. The key concept is combining multiple physics effects: speedLerp controls the base speed transition (fast to slow), while dragLerp simulates air resistance (increasing over time). The combined formula is: finalScale = directionScale * speedLerp * (1 - dragLerp). This creates particles that start fast (speedLerp = 2.0, drag = 0), gradually slow down (speedLerp decreases to 0.5), and experience increasing drag (drag increases to 0.6). The result is realistic physics where particles decelerate both from speed reduction and air resistance.",
