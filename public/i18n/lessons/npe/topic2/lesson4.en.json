  "intro": "In this lesson, you'll learn how to create multiple particle systems within a single NodeParticleSystemSet. Each system can have its own emitter shape, color, and behavior, allowing you to create complex, layered effects. You'll create a complete setup with two different particle systems - one using a Box emitter and another using a Sphere emitter.",
  "stepsTitle": "Step-by-Step Instructions",
  "steps": [
    "Create the first <filter-value>System</filter-value> block for the Box Particle System",
    "Add a <filter-value>Texture</filter-value> block to provide a texture for the particles and connect to System block",
    "Load a <textures>flare.png</textures> by load button in the Texture block properties",
    "Add a <filter-value>CreateParticle</filter-value> block with initial color (e.g., red) and size and connect to System block",
    "Add a <filter-value>BoxShape</filter-value> block to emit particles from a box volume",
    "Add UpdatePositionBlock, UpdateColorBlock, and UpdateSizeBlock",
    "Connect all blocks and add a texture for the first system",
    "Create a second SystemBlock for the Sphere Particle System",
    "Create another CreateParticleBlock with different color (e.g., blue) and size",
    "Add a SphereShapeBlock with a radius input",
    "Add UpdatePositionBlock, UpdateColorBlock, and UpdateSizeBlock for the second system",
    "Connect all blocks and add a texture for the second system",
    "Add both SystemBlocks to the set's systemBlocks array",
    "Observe how both systems run simultaneously, creating layered effects"

  "codeCopy": "Multiple particle systems in one set allow you to create complex, layered effects. Each SystemBlock runs independently, so you can have different colors, sizes, shapes, and behaviors all happening simultaneously. This is perfect for effects like fire with smoke (two systems), magical auras with particles (multiple systems), or any scenario where you need different particle behaviors in the same scene.",

    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting to add all SystemBlocks to systemBlocks array",
      "explanation": "Each SystemBlock must be added to the set's systemBlocks array. If you create a SystemBlock but don't add it, it won't run.",
      "solution": "Always add all SystemBlocks to set.systemBlocks.push(systemBlock1, systemBlock2, ...). Every SystemBlock you create must be in this array."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Using the same variable names for different systems",
      "explanation": "If you reuse variable names (like 'updatePosition' for both systems), the second system will overwrite the first, causing errors.",
      "solution": "Use unique names for each system's blocks: updatePosition1, updatePosition2, or updatePositionBox, updatePositionSphere. Set these in the properties panel on the right side of the editor."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not understanding that systems run independently",
      "explanation": "Each SystemBlock is completely independent. They don't share particles, properties, or state. This is by design for flexibility.",
      "solution": "Design each system to be self-contained. If you need systems to interact, you'll need to use scene-level logic or combine them into one system."
