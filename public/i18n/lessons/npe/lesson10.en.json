  "intro": "In this lesson, you'll learn how to use SetupSpriteSheetBlock and UpdateSpriteCellIndexBlock to create animated particle textures. Sprite sheets allow you to display different frames of animation on particles, creating effects like animated flames, explosions, or other dynamic visual effects. You'll learn to calculate sprite cell indices based on particle age to create smooth animations.",
  "stepsTitle": "Step-by-Step Instructions",
  "steps": [
    "Start with a basic particle system using PointShapeBlock",
    "Add SetupSpriteSheetBlock to configure the sprite sheet (start cell, end cell, width, height)",
    "Set the sprite sheet properties (start: 0, end: 8, width: 64, height: 64)",
    "Enable looping if you want the animation to repeat",
    "Add UpdateSpriteCellIndexBlock to update the sprite cell index",
    "Calculate sprite index from particle age: Age / Lifetime",
    "Multiply by the number of cells (end - start + 1)",
    "Convert the result to an integer using ParticleFloatToIntBlock",
    "Connect the integer cell index to UpdateSpriteCellIndexBlock's cellIndex input"

  "codeTitle": "Code Explanation",
  "codeCopy": "This lesson demonstrates sprite sheet animation. A sprite sheet is a texture containing multiple frames of animation arranged in a grid. By updating the cell index based on particle age, we create smooth animations. The formula is: cellIndex = floor((Age / Lifetime) * cellCount), where cellCount = end - start + 1. This maps the particle's lifetime (0 to 1) to the sprite sheet cells (0 to cellCount-1). Sprite sheets are essential for creating animated effects like flames, smoke, explosions, and other dynamic visual elements.",
