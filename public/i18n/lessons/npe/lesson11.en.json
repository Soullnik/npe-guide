  "intro": "In this lesson, you'll learn how to use ParticleConditionBlock to create conditional logic in your particle systems. Conditional blocks allow you to make decisions based on particle properties - for example, changing color when a particle reaches a certain age, or applying different effects based on speed. You'll learn to use comparison operations (GreaterThan, LessThan, Equal, etc.) and combine conditions with other blocks.",

  "codeTitle": "Code Explanation",
  "codeCopy": "This lesson demonstrates conditional logic using ParticleConditionBlock. The condition block evaluates a comparison (e.g., ageRatio > 0.5) and returns one value if true, another if false. This allows you to create effects that change based on particle state. For example, particles can change color when they reach half their lifetime, or apply different effects based on speed, position, or other properties. Conditional logic is essential for creating complex, state-based particle behaviors.",
