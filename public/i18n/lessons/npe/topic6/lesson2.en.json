  "codeCopy": "Vector operations are essential for advanced particle effects. ParticleVectorLengthBlock calculates the magnitude of a vector, which represents distance or speed. This can be used to create effects where particle properties (like size or color) change based on how fast the particle is moving. The formula for vector length is: length = sqrt(x² + y² + z²).",

  "commonMistakes": [
    {
      "mistake": "Using vector length incorrectly",
      "explanation": "Vector length is always positive (distance). Using it directly for effects that need negative values or specific ranges can cause issues.",
      "solution": "If you need normalized values or specific ranges, multiply or divide the length by appropriate factors. Remember: length is always >= 0."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Not understanding what vector length represents",
      "explanation": "Vector length represents distance or magnitude, not direction. It's a scalar value, not a vector.",
      "solution": "Use vector length for distance-based effects, speed calculations, or when you need to normalize vectors. For direction, use the vector itself."
