  "intro": "In this lesson, you'll learn about different emitter shapes available in the Node Particle Editor. Each shape creates particles from a different volume, giving you control over where particles spawn. We'll focus on ConeShapeBlock, which creates directional effects like fire or fountains, and understand its properties like radius, angle, radiusRange, and heightRange.",
  "stepsTitle": "Step-by-Step Instructions",
  "steps": [
    "Start with a basic particle system setup",
    "Replace BoxShapeBlock with SphereShapeBlock",
    "Connect a ParticleInputBlock to set the sphere radius",
    "Connect another ParticleInputBlock to set the radius range (0 = center only, 1 = full sphere)",
    "Add direction randomizer to control particle emission direction",
    "Experiment with different radius values to see how it affects particle distribution",
    "Try other shapes: ConeShapeBlock, CylinderShapeBlock, or PointShapeBlock"

  "codeCopy": "Different emitter shapes give you control over the spatial distribution of particles. SphereShapeBlock creates particles within a spherical volume, while BoxShapeBlock uses a rectangular volume. Each shape has specific properties like radius, height, or angle that control the emission area. The radiusRange property in SphereShapeBlock is particularly useful - it lets you control whether particles spawn only at the center (0) or throughout the entire volume (1).",
