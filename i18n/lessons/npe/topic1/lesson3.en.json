  "intro": "In this lesson, you'll learn about Age and Lifetime - two fundamental concepts for creating time-based effects. Age represents how long a particle has been alive, while Lifetime is its total lifespan. By calculating the age ratio (Age / Lifetime), we can create effects that change over time, such as particles that grow or fade as they age.",

  "codeTitle": "Code Explanation",
  "codeCopy": "This lesson introduces time-based calculations using Age and Lifetime. The age ratio (Age / Lifetime) is a value from 0 to 1 that represents how far through its life the particle is. When ageRatio = 0, the particle was just created. When ageRatio = 1, the particle is about to die. We use this ratio to create effects that change over time. For example, size = baseSize * (1 + ageRatio) makes particles grow from baseSize to 2 * baseSize as they age. The inverted ratio (1 - ageRatio) is useful for fading effects.",

    {
      "mistake": "Dividing Lifetime by Age instead of Age by Lifetime",
      "explanation": "The age ratio should be Age / Lifetime, not Lifetime / Age. The correct formula gives a value from 0 to 1.",
      "solution": "Always divide Age by Lifetime: ageRatio = Age / Lifetime. This gives 0 when particle is created, 1 when it dies."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Using Age directly without calculating ratio",
      "explanation": "Age is measured in seconds and can be any value. Without dividing by Lifetime, you can't create normalized effects.",
      "solution": "Always calculate the ratio first: ageRatio = Age / Lifetime. Then use this normalized value (0 to 1) for calculations."
    },
    {
      "mistake": "Forgetting that ageRatio increases from 0 to 1",
      "explanation": "ageRatio starts at 0 (just created) and increases to 1 (about to die). Using it directly makes things grow, using (1 - ageRatio) makes them fade.",
      "solution": "For growth effects, use ageRatio or (1 + ageRatio). For fade effects, use (1 - ageRatio). Remember: ageRatio goes from 0 to 1."
