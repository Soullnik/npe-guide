You'll learn how to randomize colors, sizes, and other properties, and understand the different lock modes that control when random values are generated.",

  "codeTitle": "Code Explanation",
  "codeCopy": "This lesson demonstrates the use of ParticleRandomBlock to add randomness to particle properties. The key concept is the lockMode property, which determines when random values are generated. OncePerParticle ensures each particle gets a random value when it's created, and that value remains constant throughout the particle's lifetime. This is perfect for properties like color and size, where you want variation between particles but consistency for each individual particle. The formula for random generation is: randomValue = min + Math.random() * (max - min).",
